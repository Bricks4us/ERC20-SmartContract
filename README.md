<b>PARKGENE Smart Contract page</b>

The repository contains  the ERC-20 Smart Contract for PARKGENE token sale

<b>Description</b>

PARKGENE is a convenient and secure way to find parking, connecting drivers, individuals and businesses.
Our vision is to establish the GENE token as the currency for the automotive industry, allowing drivers to pay for parking and integrating it with mobility services, vehicles and infrastructure.

<b>Usage of Token</b>

Drivers looking for a parking spot meet virtually with parking owners through the  PARKGENE app.
Once a driver reserves a parking spot, the reservation triggers the PARKGENE smart contract on the Ethereum Public Blockchain.
The PARKGENE App transfers the full parking fee amount, in GENEs, from the driver wallet, to a depository (a temporary wallet). In case there is not enough GENEs balance in the driver’s wallet, the driver can use his credit card or other means of payment (bitcoins, ethers) to buy GENEs realtime and pay for the transaction.
